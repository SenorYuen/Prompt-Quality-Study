a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The PDFHandler class allows merging multiple PDF files into one and extracting text from PDFs using PyPDF2 library.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - creates a list named readers using PyPDF2 (__init__)
        - merge PDFs (merge_pdfs)
        - Extract text from pdf files (extract_text_from_pdfs)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, filepaths):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will create a list named readers using PyPDF2, where each reader opens a file from the given paths.
        - This method will get "filepaths" as list of strs which is a list of file paths.
        - self.filepaths = filepaths
        - self.readers = [PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(fp) for fp in filepaths]
    - merge_pdfs(self, output_filepath):
        - This method will read files in self.readers which stores handles to multiple PDF files, and merge them to one pdf and update the page number, then save in disk. 
        - This method will get "output_filepath" as str output file path to save to.
        - This method will return  "Merged PDFs saved at {output_filepath}" if successfully merged, if not send proper message.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> handler = PDFHandler(['a.pdf', 'b.pdf'])
        - >>> handler.merge_pdfs('out.pdf')   
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : Merged PDFs saved at out.pdf
    - extract_text_from_pdfs(self):
        - This method will Extract text from pdf files in self.readers.
        - This method will return  pdf_texts: list of str, each element is the text of one pdf file.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>>  handler = PDFHandler(['a.pdf', 'b.pdf'])
        - >>> handler.extract_text_from_pdfs()   
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : ['Test a.pdf', 'Test b.pdf']
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import PyPDF2
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
