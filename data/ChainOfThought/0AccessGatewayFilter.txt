a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    -  This AccessGatewayFilter class is a filter used for accessing gateway filtering, primarily for authentication and access log recording.
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Filter incoming requests (filter)
        - Check the request URI start (is_start_with)
        - Get the user information (get_jwt_user)
        - Set and log the current user information (set_current_user_info_and_log)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self):
        - Pass
    - filter(self, request):
        - This method will filter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.
        - This method will accept "request" as dict which is the details of incoming request.
        - This method will return True if the request is allowed, False otherwise. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()
        - >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})
        - This example will return True   
    - is_start_with(self, request_uri):
        - This method will check if the request URI starts with certain prefixes.
        - This method will accept "request_uri" as str which is the URI of the request.
        - This method will return True if the URI starts with certain prefixes, False otherwise.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()
        - >>> filter.is_start_with('/api/data')
        - This example will return True   
    - get_jwt_user(self, request)
        - This method will get the user information from the JWT token in the request.
        - This method will accept "request" as dict, which is the incoming request details.
        - This method will return dict or None, the user information if the token is valid, None otherwise.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()
        - >>> filter.get_jwt_user({'headers': {'Authorization': {'user': {'name': 'user1'}, 'jwt': 'user1'+str(datetime.date.today())}}})
        - {'user': {'name': 'user1'}
    - set_current_user_info_and_log(self, user):
        - This method will set the current user information and log the access.
        - This method will accept "user" as dict, which is the user information.
        - This method will return None.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()
        - >>> user = {'name': 'user1', 'address': '127.0.0.1'}
        - >>> filter.set_current_user_info_and_log(user)
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import PyPDF2
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
