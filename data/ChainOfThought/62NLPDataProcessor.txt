a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The NLPDataProcessor is a class that processes NLP data by removing stop words from a list of strings using a predefined stop word list.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Construct a stop word list (construct_stop_word_list)
        - Remove all the stop words from the list (remove_stop_words)
        - Construct a stop word list (process)
c. Detail each method:
    - construct_stop_word_list(self):
        - This method will construct a stop word list including 'a', 'an', 'the'.
        - This method will return a list of stop words
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> NLPDataProcessor.construct_stop_word_list()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : ['a', 'an', 'the']
    - remove_stop_words(self, string_list, stop_word_list):
        - This method will remove all the stop words from the list of strings.
        - This method will get "string_list" as list which a list of strings, "stop_word_list" as list which is a list of stop words
        - This method will return a list of words without stop words
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> NLPDataProcessor.process(['This is a test.'])
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : [['This', 'is', 'test.']]
    - process(self, string_list):
        - This method will construct a stop word list including 'a', 'an', 'the', and remove all the      stop words from the list of strings.
        - This method will get "string_list" list which a list of strings.
        - This method will return a list of words without stop words
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> NLPDataProcessor.process(['This is a test.'])
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :  [['This', 'is', 'test.']] 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
