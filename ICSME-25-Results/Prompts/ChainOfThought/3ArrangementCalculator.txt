a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ArrangementCalculator class can provide permutation calculations and selection operations for a given set of data elements.
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initializes the ArrangementCalculator object (__init__)
        - Counts the number of arrangements (count)
        - Counts the total number of all possible arrangements (count_all)
        -  Generates a list of arrangements (select)
        -  Generates a list of all arrangements (select_all)
        - Calculates the factorial of a given number (factorial)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, datas):
        - This method will act as the constructor. 
        - This method will Initialize the ArrangementCalculator object with a list of datas.
        - Method will accept "datas" as List which is the data elements to be used for arrangements.
        - self.datas = datas
    - @staticmethod count(n, m=None):
        - This method will Count the number of arrangements by choosing m items from n items (permutations).
        - This method will accept " n" as int which is the total number of items, " m" as int which is the number of items to be chosen (default=None).
        - This method will return the count of arrangements as int.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> ArrangementCalculator.count(5, 3)
        - The expected return value for example usage is :60
    - @staticmethod count_all(n):
        - This method will Count the total number of all possible arrangements by choosing at least 1 item and at most n items from n items.
        - This method will accept " n" as int which is the total number of items.
        - This method will return the count of all arrangements as int.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> ArrangementCalculator.count_all(4)
        - The expected return value for example usage is :  64
    - @staticmethod select(self, m=None):
        - This method will Generate a list of arrangements by selecting m items from the internal datas.
        - This method will accept " m" as int which is the number of items to be chosen (default=None).
        - If m is not provided, select all items.
        - This method will return  a list of arrangements as List,.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> ac = ArrangementCalculator([1, 2, 3, 4])
        - >>> ac.select(2)
        - The expected return value for example usage is : [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 1], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 4], [4, 1], [4, 2], [4, 3]] 
    - @staticmethod select_all(self):
        - This method will Generate a list of all arrangements by selecting at least 1 item and at most the number of internal datas.
        - This method will return  a list of all arrangements as List,.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> ac = ac = ArrangementCalculator([1, 2, 3])
        - >>> ac.select_all()
        - The expected return value for example usage is : [[1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 1], [2, 3], [3, 1], [3, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
    - @staticmethod factorial(n):
        - This method will Calculates the factorial of a given number.
        - This method will accept "n" as int which is the number to calculate the factorial.
        - If m is not provided, selects all items.
        - This method will return  the factorial of the given number as int.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> ArrangementCalculator.factorial(4)
        - The expected return value for example usage is : 24
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
