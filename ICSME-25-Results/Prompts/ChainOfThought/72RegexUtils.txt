a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The RegexUtils provides to match, find all occurrences, split, and substitute text using regular expressions. It also includes predefined patterns, validating phone numbers and extracting email addresses.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Check if the text matches the regular expression (match)
        - Find all matching substrings (findall)
        - Split text based on regular expression patterns (split)
        - Replace the substring matched by a regular expression (sub)
        - Generate regular expression patterns that match email addresses (generate_email_pattern)
        - Generate regular expression patterns that match phone numbers (generate_phone_number_pattern)
        - Generate regular expression patterns that match the middle characters of two sentences (generate_split_sentences_pattern)
        - Split the text into a list of sentences (split_sentences)
        - Verify if the phone number is valid (validate_phone_number)
        - Extract all email addresses from the text (extract_email)
c. Detail each method:
    - match(self, pattern, text):
        - This method will check if the text matches the regular expression.
        - This method will get "pattern" as str which is the regular expression pattern, "text" as str which is the text to match.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the text matches the regular expression or not.
        - Example Usage:

    - sub(self, pattern, replacement, text):
        - This method will replace the substring matched by a regular expression with the specified string.
        - This method will get "pattern" as str which is the regular expression pattern, "replacement" as str which is the text to replace with, "text" as str which is the text to match.
        - This method will return the text after replacement as str. 
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> ru = RegexUtils()
        - >>> ru.sub(r'\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b', 'phone num',  "123-456-7890 abiguygusu 876-286-9876 kjgufwycs 987-762-9767")

d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import re 
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
