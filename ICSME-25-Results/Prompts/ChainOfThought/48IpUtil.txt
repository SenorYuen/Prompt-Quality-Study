a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The IpUtil is a class as a tool for ip that can be used to obtain the local IP address, validate its validity, and also provides the functionality to retrieve the corresponding hostname.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Check if the given IP address is a valid IPv4 address (is_valid_ipv4)
        - Check if the given IP address is a valid IPv6 address (is_valid_ipv6)
        - Get the hostname (get_hostname)
        - Return the binary form of the IP address (get_binary)
c. Detail each method:
    -  @staticmethod is_valid_ipv4(ip_address):
        - This method will check if the given IP address is a valid IPv4 address.
        - This method will get "ip_address" as str which is the IP address to check.
        - The method will return True if the IP address is valid, False otherwise. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> IpUtil.is_valid_ipv4('192.168.0.123')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True
        - >>> IpUtil.is_valid_ipv4('256.0.0.0')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : False
    -  @staticmethod is_valid_ipv6(ip_address):
        - This method will check if the given IP address is a valid IPv6 address.
        - This method will get "ip_address" as str which is the IP address to check.
        - The method will return True if the IP address is valid, False otherwise. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> IpUtil.is_valid_ipv6('2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True
        - >>> IpUtil.is_valid_ipv6('2001:0db8:85a3:::8a2e:0370:7334')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True  
    -  @staticmethod get_hostname(ip_address):
        - This method will get the hostname associated with the given IP address.
        - This method will get "ip_address" as str which is the IP address to get the hostname for.
        - The method will return the hostname associated with the IP address as str.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> IpUtil.get_hostname('110.242.68.3')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 'www.baidu.com'
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import socket
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
