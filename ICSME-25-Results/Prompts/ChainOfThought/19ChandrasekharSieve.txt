a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ChandrasekharSieve is a class that uses the Chandrasekhar's Sieve method to find all prime numbers within the range.
b. Identify the Required Methods:    
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the ChandrasekharSieve class (__init__)
        - Generate prime numbers (generate_primes)
        - Get the list of generated prime numbers (get_primes)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, n):
        - This method will act as the constructor. 
        - Initialize the ChandrasekharSieve class with the given limit.
        - This method will accept "n" as int which is the upper limit for generating prime numbers.
        - self.n = n
        - self.primes = self.generate_primes()
    - generate_primes(self):  
        - This method will generate prime numbers up to the specified limit using the Chandrasekhar sieve algorithm.
        - This method will return a list of prime numbers as list.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> cs = ChandrasekharSieve(20)
        - >>> cs.generate_primes()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :  [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
    - get_primes(self):
        - This method will Get the list of generated prime numbers.
        - This method will return a list of prime numbers as list.
        - Example Usage:
        - cs = ChandrasekharSieve(20)
        - >>> cs.get_primes()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :  [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
