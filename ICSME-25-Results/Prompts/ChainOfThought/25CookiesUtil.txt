a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The CookiesUtil is a class as a utility for managing and manipulating Cookies, including methods for retrieving, saving, and setting Cookies data.
b. Identify the Required Methods:  
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initializes the CookiesUtil (__init__)
        - Gets the cookies from the specified response (get_cookies)
        - Loads the cookies from the cookies_file (load_cookies)
        - Saves the cookies to the cookies_file (_save_cookies)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, cookies_file):
        - This method will act as the constructor. 
        - This method will initialize the CookiesUtil with the specified cookies file.
        - This method will get "cookies_file" as str which is the cookies file to use.
        - self.cookies_file = cookies_file
        - self.cookies = None
    - get_cookies(self, reponse):
        - This method will get the cookies from the specified response,and save it to cookies_file.
        - This method will get "reponse" as dict which is The response to get cookies from.    
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> cookies_util = CookiesUtil('cookies.json')
        - >>> cookies_util.get_cookies({'cookies': {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}})
        - >>> cookies_util.cookies
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
    - load_cookies(self):
        - This method will Load the cookies from the cookies_file to the cookies data.
        - This method will return the cookies data as dict. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> cookies_util = CookiesUtil('cookies.json')
        - >>> cookies_util.load_cookies()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
    - _save_cookies(self):
        - This method will save the cookies to the cookies_file, and returns True if successful, False otherwise.
        - This method will return True if successful, False otherwise.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> cookies_util = CookiesUtil('cookies.json')
        - >>> cookies_util.cookies = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
        - >>> cookies_util._save_cookies()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is: True
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import json
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
