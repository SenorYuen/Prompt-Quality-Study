User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The KappaCalculator is a class as KappaCalculator, supporting calculations of Cohen's and Fleiss' kappa coefficients.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Calculate the cohen's kappa value (kappa)

c. Detail each method:
    - @staticmethod kappa(testData, k):
        - This method will Calculate the Cohen's kappa value of a k-dimensional matrix.
        - This method will get "testData" as list of lists which is The k-dimensional matrix that needs to calculate the Cohen's kappa value, "k" as int which is the Matrix dimension. 
        - This method will return the cohen's kappa value of the matrix as float.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> KappaCalculator.kappa([[2, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2]], 3)

    - @staticmethod fleiss_kappa(testData, N, k, n):
        - This method will calculate the Fleiss kappa value of an N * k matrix.
        - This method will get "testData" as list of lists which is Input data matrix, N * k, "N" as int which is the Number of samples, "k" as int which is the number of categories, "n" as int which is the Number of raters.
        - This method will return Fleiss kappa value as float.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> KappaCalculator.fleiss_kappa([[0, 0, 0, 0, 14],
                                     [0, 2, 6, 4, 2],

                                     [7, 7, 0, 0, 0],
                                     [3, 2, 6, 3, 0],
                                     [2, 5, 3, 2, 2],
                                     [6, 5, 2, 1, 0],
                                     [0, 2, 2, 3, 7]], 10, 5, 14)
        - >>> The expected output return for example usage is : 0.20993070442195522
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import numpy as np 
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
