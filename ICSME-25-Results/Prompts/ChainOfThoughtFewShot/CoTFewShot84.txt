System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The TicTacToe class represents a game of Tic-Tac-Toe and its functions include making a move on the board, checking for a winner, and determining if the board is full.
b. To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
    - Initialize a 3x3 game board with all empty spaces and current symbol player (__init__)
    - Place the current player's mark at the specified position (make_move)
    - Check if there is a winner on the board (check_winner)
    - Check if the game board is completely filled (is_board_full)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, N=3):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize a 3x3 game board with all empty spaces and current player symbol, default is 'X'.
        - self.board = [[' ' for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(3)]
        - self.current_player = 'X'
    - make_move(self, row, col):
        - This method will place the current player's mark at the specified position on the board and switch the mark.
        - This method will get "row" as int which is the row index of the position, "col" as int which is the column index of the position
        - This method will return True or False indicating whether the move was successful or not.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> ttt.current_player
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : 'X'
        - >>> ttt.make_move(1, 1)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 'True'
        - >>> ttt.current_player
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : '0'
    - check_winner(self):
        - This method will check if there is a winner on the board in rows, columns and diagonals (three directions).
        - This method will return the mark of the winner ('X' or 'O') as str, or None if there is no winner yet.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> moves = [(1, 0), (2, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2)]
        - >>> for move in moves:
        ...     ttt.make_move(move[0], move[1])
        - >>> ttt.check_winner()
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : 'X' 
    - is_board_full(self):
        - This method will check if the game board is completely filled.
        - This method will return True or False indicating whether the game board is full or not. 
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> ttt.is_board_full()
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : False
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import 
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.           

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
