System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The MinesweeperGame is a class that implements mine sweeping games including minesweeping and winning judgment.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initializes the MinesweeperGame class with the size of the board and the number of mines (__init__)
        - Generates a minesweeper map with the given size of the board and the number of mines (generate_mine_sweeper_map)
        - Generates a player map with the given size of the board (generate_playerMap)
        - Checks whether the player has won the game (check_won)
        - Sweeps the given position (sweep)
c. Detail each method:
    -  __init__(self):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will Initialize the MinesweeperGame class with the size of the board and the number of mines.
        - This method will get "n" as int which is the size of the board, "m" as int which is the number of mines. 
        - self.n = n
        - self.k = k
        - self.minesweeper_map = self.generate_mine_sweeper_map()
        - self.player_map = self.generate_playerMap()
        - self.score = 0
    - generate_mine_sweeper_map(self):
        - This method will generate a minesweeper map with the given size of the board and the number of mines,the given parameter n is the size of the board,the size of the board is n*n,the parameter k is the number of mines,'X' represents the mine,other numbers represent the number of mines around the position.
        - The method will return the minesweeper map as list.
        - Example Usage:    
        - >>> minesweeper_game = MinesweeperGame(3, 1)
        - >>> minesweeper_game.generate_mine_sweeper_map()
        - The expected return value of example usage is : [['X', 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    - generate_playerMap(self):
        - This method will generate a player map with the given size of the board, the given parameter n is the size of the board,the size of the board is n*n,the parameter k is the number of mines,'-' represents the unknown position.
        - The method will return the player map as list.
        - Example Usage:    
        - >>> minesweeper_game = MinesweeperGame(3, 1)
        - >>> minesweeper_game.generate_playerMap()
        - The expected return value of example usage is :  [['-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-']]
    - check_won(self,map):
        - This method will check whether the player has won the game, if there are just mines in the player map.
        - This method will get the "map" as a list which is the player map.
        - The method will return True if the player has won the game, False otherwise.
        - Example Usage:    
        - >>> minesweeper_game = MinesweeperGame(3, 1)
        - >>> minesweeper_game.minesweeper_map = [['X', 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
        - >>> minesweeper_game.player_map = [['-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-']]
        - >>> minesweeper_game.check_won(minesweeper_game.player_map)
        - The expected return value of example usage is :  False     
    - sweep(self, x, y):
        - This method will sweep the given position.
        - This method will get the "x" as int which is the x coordinate of the position, "y" as int which is the y coordinate of the position.
        - The method will return True if the player has won the game, False otherwise,if the game still continues, return the player map, list.
        - Example Usage:    
        - >>> minesweeper_game = MinesweeperGame(3, 1)
        - >>> minesweeper_game.minesweeper_map = [['X', 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
        - >>> minesweeper_game.player_map = [['-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-']]
        - >>> minesweeper_game.sweep(1, 1)
        - The expected return value of example usage is :  [['-', '-', '-'], ['-', 1, '-'], ['-', '-', '-']]
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import random
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
