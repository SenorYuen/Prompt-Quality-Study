System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The DatabaseProcessor is for processing a database, supporting to create tables, insert data into the database, search for data based on name, and delete data from the database.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize database name (__init__)
        - Create a new table (create_table)
        - Insert data into the specified table  (insert_into_database)
        - Search the specified table in the database  (search_database)
        - Delete rows from the specified table (delete_from_database)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, database_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor. 
        - This method will Initialize the database name of the database processor. 
        - This method will get "database_name" as str.
        - self.database_name = database_name
    - create_table(self, table_name, key1, key2):
        - This method will create a new table in the database if it doesn't exist. And make id (INTEGER) as PRIMARY KEY, make key1 as TEXT, key2 as INTEGER.
        - This method will get "table_name" as str which is the name of the table to create, "key1" as str which is the name of the first column in the table, "key2" as str which is the name of the second column in the table
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> db.create_table('user', 'name', 'age') 
    - insert_into_database(self, table_name, data):
        - This method will insert data into the specified table in the database.
        - This method will get "table_name" as str which is the name of the table to insert data into, "data" as list which is a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a row of data.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>>  db.insert_into_database('user', [
                {'name': 'John', 'age': 25},
                {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
            ])
    - search_database(self, table_name, name):
        - This method will Search the specified table in the database for rows with a matching name.
        - This method will get "table_name" as str which is the name of the table to search, "name" as str which is the name to search for.
        - This method will return a list of tuples representing the rows with matching name, if any;
        - Example Usage:
        - >>>  db.search_database('user', 'John')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : [(1, 'John', 25)]
    - delete_from_database(self, table_name, name):
        - This method will delete rows from the specified table in the database with a matching name.
        - This method will get "table_name" as str which is the name of the table to delete rows from, "name" as str which is the name to match for deletion.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> db.delete_from_database('user', 'John')    
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import sqlite3
    - import pandas as pd
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
