System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The AvgPartition is a class that partitions the given list into different blocks by specifying the number of partitions, with each block having a uniformly distributed length.
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the class ( __init__)
        - Calculate the size of each block (setNum)
        - Get the size of each block (get)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, lst, limit):
        - This method will act as the constructor. 
        - This method will Initialize the class with the given list and the number of partitions, and check if the number of partitions is greater than 0.
        - self.lst = lst
        - self.limit = limit
    - setNum(self):
        - This method will calculate the size of each block and the remainder of the division.
        - This method will return the size of each block and the remainder of the division as tuple.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> a = AvgPartition([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
        - >>> a.setNum()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : (2, 0)
    - get(self, index):
        - This method will calculate the size of each block and the remainder of the division, and calculate the corresponding start and end positions based on the index of the partition.
        - The method will accept "index" as int which is the  index of the partition
        - This method will return the corresponding block as list.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> a = AvgPartition([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
        - >>> a.get(0)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : [1, 2]
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.  

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
