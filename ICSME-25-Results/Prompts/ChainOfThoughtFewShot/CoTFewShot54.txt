System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The MovieBookingSystem is a class that acts as a movie booking system, which allows adding movies, booking tickets and checking the available movies within a given time range. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize movies with information (__init__)
        - Add a new movie (add_movie)
        - Book tickets for a movie (book_ticket)
        - Get a list of available movies (available_movies)
c. Detail each method:
    -  __init__(self):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will Initialize movies contains the information about movies
        - self.movies = []
        - Example Usage:
        -  >>> system.movies
            [{'name': 'Batman', 'price': 49.9, 'start_time': datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 17, 5), 'end_time': datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 19, 25),
            'seats': array([[0., 0., 0.],
                [0., 0., 0.],
                [0., 0., 0.]])}]
    - add_movie(self, name, price, start_time, end_time, n):
        - This method will add a new movie into self.movies.
        - This method will get "name" as str which is the movie name, "price" as float which is the price for one ticket, "start_time" as str which is the movie start time, "end_time" as str which is the movie end time, "n" as int which is the size of seats(n*n).
        - Example Usage:    
        - >>>system.add_movie('Batman', 49.9, '17:05', '19:25', 3)
        - >>> system.movies
        - >>> The expected output of example usage is : [{'name': 'Batman', 'price': 49.9, 'start_time': datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 17, 5), 'end_time': datetime.datetime(1900, 1, 1, 19, 25),
            'seats': array([[0., 0., 0.],
            [0., 0., 0.],
            [0., 0., 0.]])}]
    - book_ticket(self, name, seats_to_book):
        - This method will book tickets for a movie. Change the seats value in self.movies if booked successfully.
        - This method will get "name" as str which is the movie name, "seats_to_book" as list of tuples which represents seats to book [(row1, col1), (row2, col2), ...]
        - This method will return the booking status message. "Movie not found." for no such movie, "Booking success." for successfully booking, or "Booking failed." otherwise.
        - Example Usage:    
        - >>> system.add_movie('Batman', 49.9, '17:05', '19:25', 3)
        - >>> system.book_ticket('Batman', [(0, 0), (0, 1)])
        - >>> The expected return value of example usage is :'Booking success.'
        - >>> system.book_ticket('Batman', [(0, 0)]) 
        - >>> The expected return value of example usage is : 'Booking failed.
        - >>> system.book_ticket('batman', [(0, 0)])
        - >>> The expected return value of example usage is :  'Movie not found.'
    - available_movies(self, start_time, end_time):
        - This method will get a list of available movies within the specified time range.
        - This method will get "start_time" as str which is the movie start time, "end_time" as str which is the movie end time.
        - This method will return the names of available movies as list of str
        - Example Usage:    
        - >>> system.add_movie('Batman', 49.9, '17:05', '19:25', 3)
        - >>> system.available_movies('12:00', '22:00')
        - >>> The expected return value of example usage is :  ['Batman']
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - from datetime import datetime
    - import numpy as np
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
