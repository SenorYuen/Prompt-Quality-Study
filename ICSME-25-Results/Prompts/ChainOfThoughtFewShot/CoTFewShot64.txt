System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The PageUtil is a versatile utility for handling pagination and search functionalities in an efficient and convenient manner.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the PageUtil object (__init__)
        - Retrieve a specific page of data (get_page)
        - Retrieve information about a specific page (get_page_info)
        - Search for items in the data (search)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, data, page_size):
       - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will Initialize the PageUtil object with the given data and page size.
        - This method will get "data" as list which is the data to be paginated, "page_size" as int which is the number of items per page.
        - self.data = data
        - self.page_size = page_size
        - self.total_items = len(data)
        - self.total_pages = (self.total_items + page_size - 1) // page_size
    - get_page(self, page_number):
        - This method will retrieve a specific page of data.
        - This method will get "page_number" as int which is the page number to fetch.
        - This method will return the data on the specified page as list.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> page_util = PageUtil([1, 2, 3, 4], 1)
        - >>> page_util.get_page(1)
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : [1]
    - get_page_info(self, page_number):
        - This method will retrieve information about a specific page.
        - This method will get "page_number" as int which is the page number to fetch information about.
        - This method will return the page information such as current page number, total pages, etc. as dict. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> page_util = PageUtil([1, 2, 3, 4], 1)
        - >>> page_util.get_page_info(1)
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : { "current_page": 1,
                                                                 "per_page": 1,
                                                                "total_pages": 4,

                                                                }
    - search(self, keyword):
        - This method will search for items in the data that contain the given keyword.
        - This method will get "keyword" as str which is the keyword to search for.
        - This method will return the search information such as total results and matching items as dict. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> page_util = PageUtil([1, 2, 3, 4], 1)
        - >>> page_util.search("1")
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : search_info = { "keyword": "1",
                                                                 "total_results": 1,
                                                                "total_pages": 1,
                                                                "results": [1]

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
