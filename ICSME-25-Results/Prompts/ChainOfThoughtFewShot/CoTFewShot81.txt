System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The StudentDatabaseProcessor is a class with database operation, including inserting student information, searching for student information by name, and deleting student information by name.
b. To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
    - Initializes the StudentDatabaseProcessor object (__init__)
    - Creates a "students" table in the database if it does not exist already (create_student_table)
    - Inserts a new student into the "students" table (insert_student)
    - Searches for a student in the "students" table by their name (search_student_by_name)
    - Deletes a student from the "students" table by their name (delete_student_by_name)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, cash_balance):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the StudentDatabaseProcessor object with the specified database name.
        - This method will get "database_name" as str which is the name of the SQLite database. 
        - self.database_name = database_name
    - create_student_table(self):
        - This method will create a "students" table in the database if it does not exist already.Fields include ID of type int, name of type str, age of type int, gender of type str, and grade of type int.
        - This method will return None.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> processor = StudentDatabaseProcessor("students.db")
        - >>> processor.create_student_table()
    - insert_student(self, student_data):
        - This method will insert a new student into the "students" table.
        - This method will get "student_data" as dict which is a dictionary containing the student's information (name, age, gender, grade).
        - This method will return None.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> processor = StudentDatabaseProcessor("students.db")
        - >>> processor.create_student_table()
        - >>> student_data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 15, 'gender': 'Male', 'grade': 9}
        - >>> processor.insert_student(student_data)
    - search_student_by_name(self, name):
        - This method will search for a student in the "students" table by their name.
        - This method will get "name" as str which is the name of the student to search for.
        - This method will return a list of tuples, the rows from the "students" table that match the search criteria.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> processor = StudentDatabaseProcessor("students.db")
        - >>> processor.create_student_table()
        - >>> result = processor.search_student_by_name("John")    
    - delete_student_by_name(self, name):
        - This method will delete a student from the "students" table by their name.
        - This method will get "name" as str which is the name of the student to delete.
        - This method will return None.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> processor = StudentDatabaseProcessor("students.db")
        - >>> processor.create_student_table()
        - >>> student_data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 15, 'gender': 'Male', 'grade': 9}
        - >>> processor.insert_student(student_data)
        - >>> processor.delete_student_by_name("John")
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import sqlite3 
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.           

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
