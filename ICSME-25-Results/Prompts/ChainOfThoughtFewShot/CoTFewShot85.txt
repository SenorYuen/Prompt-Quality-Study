System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The TimeUtils is a time util class, including getting the current time and date, adding seconds to a datetime, converting between strings and datetime objects, calculating the time difference in minutes, and formatting a datetime object.
b. To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
    - Get the current datetime (__init__)
    - Return the current time (get_current_time)
    - Return the current date (get_current_date)
    - Add the specified number of seconds to the current time (add_seconds)
    - Convert the time string to a datetime instance (string_to_datetime)
    - Convert a datetime instance to a string (datetime_to_string)
    - Calculate how many minutes have passed between two times (get_minutes)
    - Get format time(get_format_time)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will get the current datetime.
        - self.datetime = datetime.datetime.now()
    - get_current_time(self):
        - This method will return the current time as str in the format of '%H:%M:%S'.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> timeutils = TimeUtils()
        - >>> timeutils.get_current_time()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : "19:19:22"
    - get_current_date(self):
        - This method will return the current date as str in the format of "%Y-%m-%d"
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> timeutils.get_current_date()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : "2023-06-14" 
    - add_seconds(self, seconds):
        - This method will add the specified number of seconds to the current time
        - This method will get "seconds" as int which is the number of seconds to add.
        - This method will return the time after adding the specified number of seconds in the format '%H:%M:%S'. 
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> timeutils.add_seconds(600)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : "19:29:22"
    - string_to_datetime(self, string):
        - This method will convert the time string to a datetime instance.
        - This method will get "string" as str which is the string before converting format.
        - This method will return the datetime instance.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> timeutils.string_to_datetime("2001-7-18 1:1:1")
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 2001-07-18 01:01:01
    - datetime_to_string(self, datetime):
        - This method will convert the time string to a datetime instance.
        - This method will get "datetime" as datetime which is the datetime instance to convert.
        - This method will return the converted time string as str.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> timeutils.datetime_to_string(timeutils.datetime)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : "2023-06-14 19:30:03"
    - get_minutes(self, string_time1, string_time2):
        - This method will calculate how many minutes have passed between two times, and round the results to the nearest.
        - This method will get "string_time1" as str, "string_times" as str. 
        - This method will return the number of minutes between two times, rounded off as int.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> timeutils.get_minutes("2001-7-18 1:1:1", "2001-7-18 2:1:1")
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 60
    - get_format_time(self, year, month, day, hour, minute, second):
        - This method will get format time.
        - This method will get "year" as int, "month" as int, "day" as int, "hour" as int, "minute" as int, "second" as int.
        - This method will return the formatted time string.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> timeutils.get_format_time(2001, 7, 18, 1, 1, 1)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :  "2001-07-18 01:01:01"
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import datetime
    - import time 
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.           

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome.
