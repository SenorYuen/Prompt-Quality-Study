System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ClassRegistrationSystem is a class as a class registration system, allowing to register students, register them for classes, retrieve students by major, get a list of all majors, and determine the most popular class within a specific major.
b. Identify the Required Methods:  
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the registration system (__init__)
        - Register a student to the system ( register_student)
        - Register a class to the student. (register_class)
        - Get all students with the major (get_students_by_major)
        - Get all majors in the system (get_all_major)
        - Get the class with the highest enrollment in the major(get_most_popular_class_in_major)
c. Detail each method:
    -  __init__(self):
        - This method will act as the constructor. 
        - Initialize the registration system with the attribute students and students_registration_class. students is a list of student dictionaries, each student dictionary has the key of name and major. students_registration_class is a dictionaries, key is the student name, value is a list of class names
        -  self.students = []
        - self.students_registration_classes = {}
    - register_student(self, student):
        - This method will register a student to the system, add the student to the students list.
        - This method will get "student" as list.
        - This method will return 0 if the student is already registered; else return 1. 
    - register_class(self, student_name, class_name):
        - This method will register a class to the student.
        - This method will get "student_name" as str, "class_name" as str. 
        - This method will return a list of class names that the student has registered.     
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> registration_system = ClassRegistrationSystem()
        - >>> registration_system.register_class(student_name="John", class_name="CS101")
        - >>> registration_system.register_class(student_name="John", class_name="CS102")  
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : ["CS101", "CS102"] 
    - get_students_by_major(self, major):
        - This method will get all students in the major.
        - This method will get "major" as str. 
        - This method will return a list of student name in the major.     
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> registration_system = ClassRegistrationSystem()
        - >>> student1 = {"name": "John", "major": "Computer Science"}
        - >>> registration_system.register_student(student1)
        - >>> registration_system.get_students_by_major("Computer Science")  
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :  ["John"]  
    - get_all_major(self):
        - This method will get all majors in the system.
        - This method will return a list of majors.     
        - Example Usage:
        - registration_system = ClassRegistrationSystem()
        - >>> registration_system.students = [{"name": "John", "major": "Computer Science"}],
        - >>> registration_system.get_all_major(student1)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : ["Computer Science"]
    - get_most_popular_class_in_major(self, major):
        - This method will get the class with the highest enrollment in the major.
        - This method will return a string of the most popular class in this major     
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> registration_system = ClassRegistrationSystem()
        - >>> registration_system.students = [{"name": "John", "major": "Computer Science"},
                                             {"name": "Bob", "major": "Computer Science"},
                                             {"name": "Alice", "major": "Computer Science"}]
        - >>> registration_system.students_registration_classes = {"John": ["Algorithms", "Data Structures"],
                                            "Bob": ["Operating Systems", "Data Structures", "Algorithms"]}
        - >>> registration_system.get_most_popular_class_in_major("Computer Science") 
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : "Data Structures"  
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
