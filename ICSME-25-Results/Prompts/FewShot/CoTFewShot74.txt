System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The Snake class is a snake game, which allows a snake to move and eat food, and also enables it to reset, and generate a random food position.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the sign-in system ( __init__)
        - Move the snake in the specified direction (move)
        - Randomly generate a new food position (random_food_position)
        - Reset the snake to its initial state (reset)
        - Increase the length of the snake by 1 and increase the score by 10 (eat_food)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, BLOCK_SIZE, food_position):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the length of the snake, screen width, screen height, block size, snake head position, score, and food position.
        - This method will get "SCREEN_WIDTH" as int, "SCREEN_HEIGHT" as int, "BLOCK_SIZE" as itn which is the Size of moving units, "food_position" as tuple which represents the position(x, y) of food.
        - self.length = 1
        - self.SCREEN_WIDTH = SCREEN_WIDTH
        - self.SCREEN_HEIGHT = SCREEN_HEIGHT
        - self.BLOCK_SIZE = BLOCK_SIZE
        - self.positions = [((SCREEN_WIDTH / 2), (SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2))]
        - self.score = 0
        - self.food_position = food_position
    - move(self, direction):
        - This method will move the snake in the specified direction. If the new position of the snake's head is equal to the position of the food, then eat the food; If the position of the snake's head is equal to the position of its body, then start over, otherwise its own length plus one.
        - This method will get "direction" as tuple which represents the direction of movement (x, y).
        - This method will return None.
        - Example Usage: 
        - snake.move((1,1))
        - self.length = 1
        - self.positions = [(51, 51), (50, 50)]
        - self.score = 10
    - random_food_position(self):
        - This method will randomly generate a new food position, but will not place it on the snake.
        - This method will return None, it will only change the food position.
    - reset(self):
        - This method will reset the snake to its initial state. Set the length to 1, the snake head position to ((SCREEN_WIDTH/2), (SCREEN_HEIGHT/2)), the score to 0, and randomly generate a new food position.
        - This method will return None.
        - Example Usage:  
        - >>> snake = Snake(100, 100, 1, (51, 51))
        - >>> snake.reset() 
        - self.length = 1
        - self.positions = [(50, 50)]
        - self.score = 0
        - self.random_food_position()
    - eat_food(self):
        - This method will increase the length of the snake by 1 and increase the score by 100. Randomly generate a new food position, but don't place it on the snake.
        - This method will return None.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> snake = Snake(100, 100, 1, (51, 51))
        - >>> snake.move((1,1))
        - >>> snake.eat_food()
        - self.length = 2  
        - self.score = 10
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import random
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.       

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
