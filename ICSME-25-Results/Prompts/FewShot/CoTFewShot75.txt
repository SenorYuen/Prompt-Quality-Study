System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The SplitSentence is a class that supports splitting sentences, counting words in a sentence, and processing a text file to find the maximum word count.
b. To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
    - Split a string into a list of sentences (split_sentences)
    - Count the number of words in a sentence (count_words)
    - Given a text, return the number of words in the longest sentence (process_text_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - split_sentences(self, sentences_string):
        - This method will split a string into a list of sentences. Sentences end with . or ? and with a space after that. Please note that Mr. also end with . but are not sentences.
        - This method will get "sentences_string" as str which is the string to split.
        - This method will return the split sentence list as list. 
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> ss = SplitSentence()
        - >>> ss.split_sentences("aaa aaaa. bb bbbb bbb? cccc cccc. dd ddd?")
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :  ['aaa aaaa.', 'bb bbbb bbb?', 'cccc cccc.', 'dd ddd?']
    - count_words(self, sentence):
        - This method will count the number of words in a sentence. Note that words are separated by spaces and that punctuation marks and numbers are not counted as words.
        - This method will get "sentences" as str which is the sentence to be counted where words are separated by spaces.
        - This method will return the number of words in the sentence as int. 
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> ss.count_words("abc def")
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 2
    - process_text_file(self, sentences_string):
        - This method will return the number of words in the longest sentence in a given text.
        - This method will get "sentences_string" as str which is the undivided long sentence.
        - This method will return the number of words in the longest sentence as int. 
        - Example Usage: 
        >>> ss.process_text_file("aaa aaaa. bb bbbb bbb? cccc ccccccc cc ccc. dd ddd?")
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 4
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import re
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.         

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
