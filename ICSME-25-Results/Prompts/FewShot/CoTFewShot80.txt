User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The StockPortfolioTracker is a class as StockPortfolioTracker that allows to add stocks, remove stocks, buy stocks, sell stocks, calculate the total value of the portfolio, and obtain a summary of the portfolio. 
b. To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
    - Initialize the StockPortfolioTracker class (__init__)
    - Add a stock to the portfolio (add_stock)
    - Remove a stock from the portfolio (remove_stock)
    - Buy a stock and add it to the portfolio (buy_stock)
    - Sell a stock and remove it from the portfolio (sell_stock)
    - Calculate the total value of the portfolio (calculate_portfolio_value)
    - Get a summary of the portfolio (get_portfolio_summary)
    - Get the value of a stock (get_stock_value)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, cash_balance):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the StockPortfolioTracker class with a cash balance and an empty portfolio.
        - This method will get "cash_balance" as a parameter. 
        - self.portfolio = []
        - self.cash_balance = cash_balance

        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> tracker = StockPortfolioTracker(10000.0)
        - >>> tracker.add_stock({"name": "AAPL", "price": 150.0, "quantity": 10})
        - >>> tracker.portfolio
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : [{'name': 'AAPL', 'price': 150.0, 'quantity': 10}]
    - remove_stock(self, stock):
        - This method will remove a stock from the portfolio.

        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage:

        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")

    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd")
