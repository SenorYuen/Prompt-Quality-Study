System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The BitStatusUtil is a utility class that provides methods for manipulating and checking status using bitwise operations.
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Add a status to the current status (add)
        - Check if the current status contains the specified status (has)
        - Remove the specified status from the current status (remove)
        - Check if the parameters are legal (check)     
c. Detail each method:
    - @staticmethod add(states, stat):
        - This method will Add a status to the current status,and check the parameters whether they are legal.
        - This method will accept "states" as int which is the current status, "stat" as int which is Status to be added.
        - This method will return The status after adding the status as int. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> bit_status_util = BitStatusUtil()
        - >>> bit_status_util.add(2,4)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 6
    - @staticmethod has(states, stat):
        - This method will Check if the current status contains the specified status,and check the parameters whether they are legal.
        - This method will accept "states" as int which is the current status, "stat" as int which is Specified status.
        - This method will return True if the current status contains the specified status,otherwise False.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> bit_status_util = BitStatusUtil()
        - >>> bit_status_util.has(6,2)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True
    - @staticmethod remove(states, stat):
        - This method will Remove the specified status from the current status,and check the parameters whether they are legal.
        - This method will accept "states" as int which is the current status, "stat" as int which is Specified status.
        - This method will return The status after removing the specified status as int.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> bit_status_util = BitStatusUtil()
        - >>> bit_status_util.remove(6,2)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 4
    - @staticmethod check(args):
        - This method will check if the parameters are legal, args must be greater than or equal to 0 and must even,if not,raise ValueError.
        - This method will accept "args" as list which is the Parameters to be checked. 
        - This method will return None
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> bit_status_util = BitStatusUtil()
        - >>>  bit_status_util.check([2,3,4])
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : Traceback (most recent call last):
        - >>> ...
        - >>> ValueError: 3 not even    
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
