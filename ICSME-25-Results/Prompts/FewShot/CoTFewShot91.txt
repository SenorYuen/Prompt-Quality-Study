System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The UserLoginDB is a database management class for user login verification, providing functions for inserting user information, searching user information, deleting user information, and validating user login.
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initializes the UserLoginDB object ( __init__)
        - Inserts a new user into the "users" table (insert_user)
        - Searches for users in the "users" table (search_user_by_username)
        - Deletes a user from the "users" table (delete_user_by_username)
        - Determine whether the user can log in (validate_user_login)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, db_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the UserLoginDB object with the specified database name.
        - This method get "db_name" as str which is the name of the SQLite database.
        - self.connection = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
        - self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()
    - insert_user(self, username, password):
        - This method will insert a new user into the "users" table.
        - This method will get "username" as str which is the username of the user,  "password" as str which is the password of the user.
        - this method will return None.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> user_db = UserLoginDB("user_database.db")
        - >>> user_db.create_table()
        - >>> user_db.insert_user('user1', 'pass1')
    - search_user_by_username(self, username):
        - This method will search for users in the "users" table by username.
        - This method will get "username" as str which is the username of the user to search for.
        - this method will return the rows from the "users" table that match the search criteria as a list of tuples.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> user_db = UserLoginDB("user_database.db")
        - >>> user_db.create_table()
        - >>> user_db.insert_user('user1', 'pass1')
        - >>> result = user_db.search_user_by_username('user1') 
        - >>> len(result)
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : 1
    - delete_user_by_username(self, username):
        - This method will delete a user from the "users" table by username.
        - This method will get "username" as str which the username of the user to delete.
        - this method will return None.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> user_db = UserLoginDB("user_database.db")
        - >>> user_db.create_table()
        - >>> user_db.insert_user('user1', 'pass1')
        - >>> user_db.delete_user_by_username('user1')
 - validate_user_login(self, username, password):
    - This method will determine whether the user can log in, that is, the user is in the database and the password is correct.
       - This method will get "username" as str which is the username of the user to validate,  "password" as str which the password of the user to validate.
        - This method will return True or False representing whether the user can log in correctly.
        - Example Usage:   
        - >>> user_db = UserLoginDB("user_database.db")
        - >>> user_db.create_table()
        - >>> user_db.insert_user('user1', 'pass1')
        - >>> user_db.validate_user_login('user1', 'pass1')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import sqlite3
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.     

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
