System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for completing the code for a class. Please provide only code with comments in the response.

User Prompt:
Using the example solution included later, please complete the class AvgPartition in the subsequent code: 
class AvgPartition:
    """
    This is a class that partitions the given list into different blocks by specifying the number of partitions, with each block having a uniformly distributed length.
    """

    def __init__(self, lst, limit):
        """
        Initialize the class with the given list and the number of partitions, and check if the number of partitions is greater than 0.

        self.lst = lst
        self.limit = limit

    def setNum(self):
        """
        Calculate the size of each block and the remainder of the division.
        :return: the size of each block and the remainder of the division, tuple.

        >>> a.setNum()
        (2, 0)

        """


    def get(self, index):
        """
        calculate the size of each block and the remainder of the division, and calculate the corresponding start and end positions based on the index of the partition.
