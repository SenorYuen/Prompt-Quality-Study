System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The JSONProcessor is a class to process JSON files, including reading and writing JSON files, as well as processing JSON data by removing a specified key from the JSON object.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Read a JSON file and return the data (read_json)
        - Write data to a JSON file (write_json)
        - read a JSON file and process the data (process_json)
c. Detail each method:
    - read_json(self, file_path):
        - This method will Read a JSON file and return the data.
        - This method will get "file_path" as str which is the path of the JSON file.
        - This method will return the data from the JSON file as dict if read successfully, or return -1 if an error occurs during the reading process, return 0 if the file does not exist.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> json.read_json('test.json')
        - >>> The expected output return for example usage is : {'name': 'test', 'age': 14}
    - write_json(self, data, file_path):
        - This method will be used to write data to a JSON file and save it to the given path.
        - This method will get "data" as dict which is the data to be written to the JSON file, "file_path" as str which is the path of the JSON file.
        - The method will return 1 if the writing process is successful, or -1, if an error occurs during the writing process. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> json.write_json({'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}, 'test.json')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 1
        - >>> json.read_json('test.json')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
    - process_json(self, file_path, remove_key):
        - This method will read a JSON file and process the data by removing a specified key and rewriting the modified data back to the file.
        - This method will get "file_path" as str which is the path of the JSON file, "remove_key" as str which is the key to be removed.
        - The method will return 1 if the specified key is successfully removed and the data is written back, 0 if the file does not exist or the specified key does not exist in the data.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> json.read_json('test.json')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :  {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
        - >>> json.process_json('test.json', 'key1')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 1  
        - >>> json.read_json('test.json')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :  {'key2': 'value2'}
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import json
    - import os
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
