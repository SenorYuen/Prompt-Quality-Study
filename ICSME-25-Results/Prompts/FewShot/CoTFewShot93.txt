System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The VendingMachine is a class that provides vector operations, including calculating similarity, cosine similarities, average similarity, and IDF weights.
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the vending machines (__init__)
        - Add a product to the vending machine (add_item)
        - Insert coins into the vending machine (insert_coin)
        - Purchase a product from the vending machine (purchase_item)
        - Replenish the inventory of a product already in the vending machine(restock_item)
        - Display the products in the vending machine (display_items)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the vending machine's inventory and balance.
        - self.inventory = {}
        - self.balance = 0
    - add_item(self, item_name, price, quantity):
        - This method will add a product to the vending machine's inventory.
        - This method will get "item_name" as str which is the name of the product to be added, "price" as float which is the price of the product to be added.
        - This method will return None.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> vendingMachine = VendingMachine()
        - >>> vendingMachine.add_item('Coke', 1.25, 10)
        - >>> vendingMachine.inventory
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}}
    - insert_coin(self, amount):
        - This method will inserts coins into the vending machine.
        - This method will get "amount" as float which is the amount of coins to be inserted.
        - This method will return The balance of the vending machine after the coins are inserted as float.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> vendingMachine = VendingMachine()
        - >>> vendingMachine.insert_coin(1.25)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 1.25
    - purchase_item(self, item_name):
        - This method will purchase a product from the vending machine and returns the balance after the purchase and displays purchase unsuccessful if the product is out of stock.
        - This method will get "item_name" as str which is the name of the product to be purchased.
        - This method will return the balance of the vending machine after the product is purchased as float if successful, otherwise returns False.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> vendingMachine = VendingMachine()
        - >>> vendingMachine.inventory = {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}}
        - >>> vendingMachine.balance = 1.25
        - >>> vendingMachine.purchase_item('Coke')  
        - >>> The expected output value for example usage is : 0.0  
        - >>> vendingMachine.purchase_item('Pizza')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : False
    - restock_item(self, item_name, quantity):
        - This method will replenish the inventory of a product already in the vending machine.
        - This method will get "item_name" as str which is the name of the product to be replenished, "quantity" as int which is the quantity of the product to be replenished.
        - This method will return True if the product is already in the vending machine, otherwise returns False.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> vendingMachine = VendingMachine()
        - >>> vendingMachine.inventory = {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10}}
        - >>> vendingMachine.restock_item('Coke', 10)
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True
        - >>> vendingMachine.restock_item('Pizza', 10)  
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : False
    - display_items(self):
        - This method will display the products in the vending machine.
        - This method will return a list of the products in the vending machine, If the vending machine is empty the method returns False.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> vendingMachine = VendingMachine()
        - >>> vendingMachine.display_items()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : False  
        - >>> vendingMachine.inventory = {'Coke': {'price': 1.25, 'quantity': 10} }
        - >>> vendingMachine.display_items()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 'Coke - $1.25 [10]'
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import 
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.       

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
