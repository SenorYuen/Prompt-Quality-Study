System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The AutomaticGuitarSimulator class is an automatic guitar simulator that can interpret and play based on the input guitar sheet music.
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the score to be played (__init__)
        - Interpret the music score to be played (interpret)
        - Print out chord and play tune (display)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, text) -> None:
        - This method will act as the constructor. 
        - This method Initialize the score to be played
        - This Method will "text" as str, which is the score to be played
        - self.play_text = text
    - interpret(self, display=False):
        - This method will  Interpret the music score to be played
        - This Method will get the "display" as a bool which is representing whether to print the interpreted score
        - This method will return list of dict as dict which includes two fields, Chore and Tune, which are letters and numbers, respectively
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> context = AutomaticGuitarSimulator("C53231323 Em43231323 F43231323 G63231323")
        - >>> play_list = context.interpret(display = False)
        - The expected return value for example usage is : [{'Chord': 'C', 'Tune': '53231323'}, {'Chord': 'Em', 'Tune': '43231323'}, {'Chord': 'F', 'Tune': '43231323'}, {'Chord': 'G', 'Tune': '63231323'}]
    -display(self, key, value):
        - This method will Print out chord and play tune with following format: Normal Guitar Playing -- Chord: %s, Play Tune: %s
        - This Method will get the "key" as a str which represents chord, "value" as a str which represents play tune
        - This method will return a string
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> context = AutomaticGuitarSimulator("C53231323 Em43231323 F43231323 G63231323")
        - >>> context.display("C", "53231323")
        - The expected return value for example usage is : Normal Guitar Playing -- Chord: C, Play Tune: 53231323
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.  
 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
