System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The NLPDataProcessor2 is a class that processes NLP data by extracting words from a list of strings, calculating the frequency of each word, and returning the top 5 most frequent words.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - keep only English letters and spaces in the string (process_data)
        - Calculate the word frequency of each word (calculate_word_frequency)
        - keep only English letters and spaces in the string (process)
c. Detail each method:
    - process_data(self, string_list):
        - This method will keep only English letters and spaces in the string, then convert the string to lower case, and then split the string into a list of words.
        - This method will get "string_list" as list which is a list of strings.
        This method will return words_list: a list of words lists
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> NLPDataProcessor.process_data(['This is a test.'])
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :[['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']]
    - calculate_word_frequency(self, words_list):
        - This method will calculate the word frequency of each word in the list of words list, and sort the word frequency dictionary by value in descending order.
        - This method will get "word_list" as list of lists which is a list of words list.
        - This method will return the top 5 word frequency dictionary, a dictionary of word frequency, key is word, value is frequency.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> NLPDataProcessor.calculate_word_frequency([['this', 'is', 'a', 'test'], ['this', 'is', 'another', 'test']])
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is :{'this': 2, 'is': 2, 'test': 2, 'a': 1, 'another': 1} 
    - process(self, string_list):
        - This method will keep only English letters and spaces in the string, then convert the string to lower case, and then split the string into a list of words. Calculate the word frequency of each word in the list of words list, and sort the word frequency dictionary by value in descending order.
        - This method will get "string_list" as list which is a list of strings. 
        - This method will return the top 5 word frequency dictionary, a dictionary of word frequency, key is word, value is frequency.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> NLPDataProcessor.process(['This is a test.', 'This is another test.'])
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : {'this': 2, 'is': 2, 'test': 2, 'a': 1, 'another': 1}
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - from collections import Counter
    - import re
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
