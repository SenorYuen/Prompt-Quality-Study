System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ExcelProcessor is a class for processing excel files, including reading and writing excel data, as well as processing specific operations and saving as a new excel file.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Reading data from Excel files (read_excel)
        - Write data to the specified Excel filer (write_excel)
        - Change the specified column in the Excel file to uppercase (process_excel_data)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self):
        - pass
    - read_excel(self, file_name):
        - This method will read data from Excel files.
        - This method will get "file_name" as str which is the Excel file name to read.
        - This method will return list of data which is Data in Excel.
    - write_excel(self, data, file_name):
        - This method will Write data to the specified Excel file.
        - This method will get "data" as list which is the Data to be written, "file_name" as str which is the excel file name to write to.
        - This method will return 0 or 1, 1 represents successful writing, 0 represents failed writing.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> processor = ExcelProcessor()
        - >>> new_data = [
             ('Name', 'Age', 'Country'),
             ('John', 25, 'USA'),
            ('Alice', 30, 'Canada'),
            ('Bob', 35, 'Australia'),
            ('Julia', 28, 'Germany')
        ]
        - >>> data = processor.write_excel(new_data, 'test_data.xlsx')  
    - process_excel_data(self, N, save_file_name):
        - This method will Change the specified column in the Excel file to uppercase.
        - This method will get "N" as int which is the serial number of the column that want to change, "save_file_name" as str which is the source file name.
        - This method will return (int, str), The former is the return value of write_excel, while the latter is the saved file name of the processed data. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> processor = ExcelProcessor() 
        - >>> success, output_file = processor.process_excel_data(1, 'test_data.xlsx')
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import openpyxl
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.            

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
