System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for completing the code for a class. Please provide only code with comments in the response.

User Prompt:
Using the example solution included later, please complete the class UrlPath in the subsequent code: 
import urllib.parse

        Initializes the UrlPath object with an empty list of segments and a flag indicating the presence of an end tag.
