System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The Classroom is a class representing a classroom, capable of adding and removing courses, checking availability at a given time, and detecting conflicts when scheduling new courses.
b. Identify the Required Methods:  
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the classroom management system (__init__)
        - Add course to self.courses list (add_course)
        - Remove course from self.courses (remove_course)
        - Check the time is free or not (is_free_at)
        - Check if the new course time conflicts (check_course_conflict)
c. Detail each method:
    -  __init__(self, id):
        - This method will act as the constructor. 
        - This method will Initialize the classroom management system.
        - This method will get "id" as int which is the id of the classroom.  
        - self.id = id
        - self.courses = []
    - add_course(self, course):
        - This method will add the course to self.courses list if the course wasn't in it.
        - This method will get "course" as dict which is the information of the course, including 'start_time', 'end_time' and 'name'. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> classroom = Classroom(1)
        - >>> classroom.add_course({'name': 'math', 'start_time': '8:00', 'end_time': '9:40'}) 
    - remove_course(self, course):
        - This method will remove course from the self.courses list if the course was in it.
        - This method will get "course" as dict which is the information of the course, including 'start_time', 'end_time' and 'name'. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> classroom = Classroom(1)
        - >>> classroom.add_course({'name': 'math', 'start_time': '8:00', 'end_time': '9:40'})
        - >>> classroom.add_course({'name': 'math', 'start_time': '8:00', 'end_time': '9:40'})
    - is_free_at(self, check_time):   
        - This method will change the time format as '%H:%M' and check if the time is free or not in the classroom.
        - This method will get "check_time" as str which is the time needed to be checked.
        - This method will return True if the check_time does not conflict with every course time, or False otherwise.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> classroom = Classroom(1)
        - >>> classroom.add_course({'name': 'math', 'start_time': '8:00', 'end_time': '9:40'})
        - >>> classroom.is_free_at('10:00')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True 
        - >>> classroom.is_free_at('9:00')
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : False
    - check_course_conflict(self, new_course):  
        - Before adding a new course, this method will check if the new course time conflicts with any other course.
        - This method will get "new_course" as dict which is the information of the course, including 'start_time', 'end_time' and 'name'.
        - This method will return False if the new course time conflicts(including two courses having the same boundary time) with other courses, or True otherwise.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> classroom = Classroom(1)
        - >>> classroom.add_course({'name': 'math', 'start_time': '8:00', 'end_time': '9:40'})
        - >>> classroom.check_course_conflict({'name': 'SE', 'start_time': '9:40', 'end_time': '10:40'})
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : False  
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - datetime import datetime
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code. 

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
