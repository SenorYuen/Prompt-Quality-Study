System Prompt:
Provided are instructions for generating the code for a class. Please provide the only code in your response.

User Prompt:
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The Order class is a class that manages restaurant orders by allowing the addition of dishes, calculation of the total cost, and checkout.
b. Identify the Required Methods:      
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize the order management system (__init__)
        - Check the self.menu and add into self.selected_dish if the dish count is valid (add_dish)
        - Calculate the total price of dishes (calculate_total)
        - Check out the dished ordered (checkout)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self):
     - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will Initialize the order management system.
        -  self.menu = []
        - self.selected_dishes = []
        - self.sales = {}
        - self.menu stores the dishes of restaurant inventory.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> menu = [{"dish": dish name, "price": price, "count": count}, ...]
        - self.selected_dishes stores the dished selected by customer
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> selected_dish = {"dish": dish name, "count": count, price: price}
        - self.sales stores the sales of each dish.
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> sales = {dish name: sales}
    - add_dish(self, dish):
        - This method will check the self.menu and add into self.selected_dish if the dish count is valid, and if the dish has successfully been added, change the count in self.menu.
        - This method will get "dish" as dict which is the information of the dish. dish is formatted like {"dish": dish name, "count": count, price: price}
        - This method will return True if successfully added, or False otherwise.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> order = Order()
        - >>> order.menu.append({"dish": "dish1", "price": 10, "count": 5})
        - >>> order.add_dish({"dish": "dish1", "price": 10, "count": 3}) 
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True  
    - calculate_total(self):
        - This method will calculate the total price of dishes that have been ordered. Multiply the count, price and sales.
        - This method will return the final total price as float.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> order = Order()
        - >>> order.menu.append({"dish": "dish1", "price": 10, "count": 5})
        - >>> order.sales = {"dish1": 0.8}
        - >>> order.add_dish({"dish": "dish1", "price": 10, "count": 4})
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True
        - >>> order.calculate_total()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 32.0 
    - checkout(self):
        - This method will check out the dishes ordered. IF the self.selected_dishes is not empty, invoke the calculate_total method to check out.
        - This method will return False if the self.selected_dishes is empty, or total (return value of calculate_total) otherwise.
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> order = Order()
        - >>> order.menu.append({"dish": "dish1", "price": 10, "count": 5})
        - >>> order.sales = {"dish1": 0.8}
        - >>> order.add_dish({"dish": "dish1", "price": 10, "count": 4})
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : True
        - >>> order.checkout()
        - >>> The expected return value for example usage is : 32.0  
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - No import 
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Include explanatory comments and the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.

 Use the following prompt and solution pair as context for generating the previously mentioned class: 
a. Understand the Overall Purpose:
    - The ZipFileProcessor class can read and decompress zip files. The ZipFileProcessor class also can compress a list of specified files into a zip file. 
b. Identify the Required Methods:
    - To ensure the function of this class, it will need all of these methods:
        - Initialize file name (__init__)
        - Read files (read_zip_file)
        - Extract all files (extract_all)
        - Extract a specific file identified by name (extract_file)
        - Compress files into zip (create_zip_file)
c. Detail each method:
    - __init__(self, file_name):
        - This method will act as the constructor.
        - This method will initialize the file name.
        - This Method will accept "file_name" as str ehich is the name of the file to be processed.
        - self.file_name = file_name
    - read_zip_file(self):
        - This method will get open file object, and return the open file object if successful; otherwise, returns None
        - Example Usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> file = zfp.read_zip_file()
    - extract_all(self, output_path):
        - This method will extract all zip files and place them in the specified path
        - This method will get the "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file.
        - This method will return True or False to represent if the extraction operation was successful. 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_all("result/aaa")
    - extract_file(self, file_name, output_path):  
        - This method will extract the file with the specified name from the zip file and place it in the specified path  
        - This method will get "file_name" as str whcih is the name of the file to be uncompressed, "output_path" as str which is the location of the extracted file. 
        - The method will return True or False, representing whether the extraction operation was successful
        - Example usage: 
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.extract_file("bbb.txt", "result/aaa")
    - create_zip_file(self, files, output_file_name):
        - This method will compress the specified file list into a zip file and place it in the specified path. 
        - This method will get "files" as a list of string which is the List of files to compress, "output_file_name" as str which specifies output path.
        - This method will return True or False, representing whether the compression operation was successful 
        - Example Usage:
        - >>> zfp = ZipFileProcessor("aaa.zip")
        - >>> zfp.create_zip_file(["bbb.txt", "ccc,txt", "ddd.txt"], "output/bcd") 
d. Plan the implementation:
    - For each method, consider the input parameters, the actions that must be performed, and the expected outcome. 
e. Import statements:
    - import zipfile
f. Implement the methods:
    - Write the code for each method step-by-step, following this outlined plan. Please only include the code output in your response, and do not include example usage or test cases in this code.
